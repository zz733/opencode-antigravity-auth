# Antigravity OAuth Plugin for Opencode

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/opencode-antigravity-auth.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-antigravity-auth)

Enable Opencode to authenticate against **Antigravity** (Google's IDE) via OAuth so you can use Antigravity rate limits and access models like `gemini-3-pro-high` and `claude-opus-4-5-thinking` with your Google credentials.

## What you get

- **Google OAuth sign-in** (multi-account via `opencode auth login`) with automatic token refresh
- **Multi-account load balancing** Automatically cycle through multiple Google accounts to maximize rate limits
- **Automatic endpoint fallback** between Antigravity API endpoints (daily → autopush → prod)
- **Antigravity API compatibility** for OpenAI-style requests
- **Debug logging** for requests and responses
- **Drop-in setup** Opencode auto-installs the plugin from config

## Quick start

### Step 1: Create your config file

If this is your first time using Opencode, create the config directory first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode
```

Then create or edit the config file at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-antigravity-auth@1.1.4"]
}
```

> **Note:** You can also use a project-local `.opencode.json` file in your project root instead. The global config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` applies to all projects.

### Step 2: Authenticate

Run the authentication command:

```bash
opencode auth login
```

1. Select **Google** as the provider
2. Select **OAuth with Google (Antigravity)**
3. **Project ID prompt:** You'll see this prompt:
   ```
   Project ID (leave blank to use your default project):
   ```
   **Just press Enter to skip this** — it's optional and only needed if you want to use a specific Google Cloud project. Most users can leave it blank.
4. Sign in via the browser and return to Opencode. If the browser doesn't open, copy the displayed URL manually.
5. After signing in, you can add more Google accounts (up to 10) for load balancing, or press Enter to finish.

> **Alternative:** For a quick single-account setup without project ID options, open `opencode` and use the `/connect` command instead.

### Step 3: Add the models you want to use

Open the **same config file** you created in Step 1 (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`) and add the models under `provider.google.models`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-antigravity-auth@1.1.4"],
  "provider": {
    "google": {
      "models": {
        "gemini-3-pro-high": {
          "name": "Gemini 3 Pro High (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 1048576,
            "output": 65535
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        },
        "gemini-3-pro-low": {
          "name": "Gemini 3 Pro Low (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 1048576,
            "output": 65535
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        },
        "gemini-3-flash": {
          "name": "Gemini 3 Flash (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 1048576,
            "output": 65536
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        },
        "claude-sonnet-4-5": {
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 200000,
            "output": 64000
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        },
        "claude-sonnet-4-5-thinking": {
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 200000,
            "output": 64000
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        },
        "claude-opus-4-5-thinking": {
          "name": "Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 200000,
            "output": 64000
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        },
        "gpt-oss-120b-medium": {
          "name": "GPT-OSS 120B Medium (Antigravity)",
          "limit": {
            "context": 131072,
            "output": 32768
          },
          "modalities": {
            "input": ["text", "image", "pdf"],
            "output": ["text"]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** You only need to add the models you plan to use. The example above includes all available models, but you can remove any you don't need. The `modalities` field enables image and PDF support in the TUI.

### Step 4: Use a model

```bash
opencode run "Hello world" --model=google/gemini-3-pro-high
```

Or start the interactive TUI and select a model from the model picker:

```bash
opencode
```

## Multi-account load balancing

The plugin supports multiple Google accounts to maximize rate limits and provide automatic failover.

### How it works

- **Round-robin selection:** Each request uses the next account in the pool
- **Automatic failover:** On HTTP `429` (rate limit), the plugin automatically switches to the next available account
- **Smart cooldown:** Rate-limited accounts are temporarily cooled down and automatically become available again after the cooldown expires
- **Single-account retry:** If you only have one account, the plugin waits for the rate limit to reset and retries automatically
- **Toast notifications:** The TUI shows which account is being used and when switching occurs

### Adding accounts

**CLI flow (`opencode auth login`):**

When you run `opencode auth login` and already have accounts saved, you'll be prompted:

```
2 account(s) saved:
  1. user1@gmail.com
  2. user2@gmail.com

(a)dd new account(s) or (f)resh start? [a/f]:
```

- Press `a` to add more accounts to your existing pool
- Press `f` to clear all existing accounts and start fresh

**TUI flow (`/connect`):**

The `/connect` command in the TUI adds accounts non-destructively — it will never clear your existing accounts. To start fresh via TUI, run `opencode auth logout` first, then `/connect`.

### Account storage

- Account pool is stored in `~/.config/opencode/antigravity-accounts.json` (or `%APPDATA%\opencode\antigravity-accounts.json` on Windows)
- This file contains OAuth refresh tokens; **treat it like a password** and don't share or commit it
- The plugin automatically syncs with OpenCode's auth state — if you log out via OpenCode, stale account storage is cleared automatically

### Automatic account recovery

- If Google revokes a refresh token (`invalid_grant`), that account is automatically removed from the pool
- Rerun `opencode auth login` to re-add the account

## Debugging

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
export OPENCODE_ANTIGRAVITY_DEBUG=1
```

Logs are written to the current directory (e.g., `antigravity-debug-<timestamp>.log`).

## Development

```bash
npm install
```
